# Okta

Cyscale enables you to keep track and secure your Okta identities. You connect your Okta organization(s) by creating an [API Token](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/API.htm?cshid=Security_API#Security_API) that Cyscale uses to read your Okta resources.

## Connecting Your Okta Organization

Once you are ready to connect your Okta organization and have the required permissions, press the **Create** button from the top-right corner, select **Add Connector**, and choose **Okta**. You will be greeted with a simple multi-step process.

### Step 1

In the first step, you provide a **name** for your Okta connector to be used throughout Cyscale. This is a plain-text identifier that helps you better manage your resources.

Here, you also provide the **organization URL** - _https://my-org.okta.com_ for example.

### Step 2

In the second step, you provide the API token that grants Cyscale access. You can find the exact steps to follow in order to create the token within the application.

:::info Token Permissions
Okta API tokens inherit the permissions of the user that creates them. Ideally, you would have a separate Okta user with read-only permissions (besides permission to create API Tokens) that you use to create the token.

## Managing Your Connected Okta Organization(s)

Once connected, your Okta organization(s) will show up in the [Connectors](https://app.cyscale.com/#/connectors) list. You can perform the following actions:

### Configure

You can update the following information for your Okta connectors:

- Identity Provider Name - this helps you better identify the connector throughout Cyscale
- **Okta API Token** - you might want to rotate the token or, in case the token hasn't been used for more than 30 days, you will have to replace it
