## Azure Marketplace

If you already use Azure, subscribe to Cyscale through the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/cyscale.cyscale) (or [Azure Portal link](https://portal.azure.com/#create/cyscale.cyscale/preview)). If you are not using Azure but are still using Microsoft products, you can subscribe to Cyscale through [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/cyscale.cyscale).

## Usage

The primary usage metric in Cyscale is the asset. This represents a node in the security knowledge graph. Examples of assets include EC2 instances, EBS volumes, VPCs, buckets, Azure AD users, GCP service accounts, Okta applications, etc.

Cyscale counts each unique resource seen at least once during the billing period as a separate asset.

You can always see how many assets Cyscale has read monthly on the [usage page](https://app.cyscale.com/#/usage). The information could be delayed by a few minutes.

Certain assets like volume/disk snapshots, prefix lists, and subnetworks do not count toward your usage.

## Invoicing

Once we have exchanged all the required billing information, we will email you the invoices. You can pay them via wire transfer.
