By default, all cloud accounts are enabled. If you want to prevent Cyscale from syncing and assessing your assets for a certain cloud account, you can disable that account. The state of cloud account in Cyscale will be locked until you enable it again. The assets will not be updated based on your actual cloud infrastructure and assessments will not be performed for them.
