## Cyscale Cloud Platform

Cyscale Cloud Platform (Cyscale) helps organizations build and run secure and compliant cloud environments.

As a [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) recognized by Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2I6V52K2&ct=240726), Cyscale provides comprehensive cloud security capabilities including CSPM, CIEM, KSPM, and DSPM. While these classifications are helpful for security professionals, we prefer to explain our core capabilities in practical terms:

### Key Capabilities

- **Unified Cloud Asset Inventory**

  Connect your cloud accounts and identity providers through secure, provider-specific mechanisms. Cyscale discovers your infrastructure through native APIs, creating a comprehensive snapshot in a unified format. This enables deep analysis across multiple cloud providers, accounts, and regions.

- **Security Posture Assessment**

  Once connected, Cyscale continuously evaluates your infrastructure against CIS benchmarks and Well-Architected Frameworks. We identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, helping you build more secure and robust systems. Results are presented as actionable alerts during each asset synchronization.

- **Cloud Identity Management**

  Monitor and secure identity relationships across your cloud environments. Detect overprivileged accounts, analyze permission boundaries, and enforce least-privilege access principles through automated assessment of roles, policies, and effective permissions.

- **Kubernetes Security**

  Protect your container workloads with dedicated Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM). Identify misconfigurations, validate security best practices, and ensure compliance across your Kubernetes clusters, pods, and containers.

- **Data Security**

  Discover, classify, and protect sensitive data across cloud storage services. Monitor data access patterns, detect exposure risks, and ensure compliance with data protection requirements through continuous data security posture management (DSPM).

- **Runtime Protection**

  Detect and respond to threats in real-time across your cloud workloads. Monitor container runtime behavior, identify anomalies, and prevent attacks through automated security policies and incident response workflows.

- **Compliance Management**

  Our security controls map directly to major standards like ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, and HIPAA. While these frameworks specify what to implement (like encryption and MFA), Cyscale helps you define how to implement them across different cloud providers and services. Our policy editor lets you precisely map your organization's compliance requirements to actual cloud configurations.

## Security Knowledge Graph

The Security Knowledge Graph provides context-aware security analysis that goes beyond simple configuration checks. For example:

- A public-facing RDS instance represents an immediate risk
- A permissive security group only poses risk when attached to active resources
- Many vulnerabilities have reduced impact when assets aren't internet-accessible

This context-aware approach helps you:

- Understand the relationships between cloud resources
- Identify actual exploitation paths
- Prioritize remediation based on real risk
- Focus on addressing critical issues first
