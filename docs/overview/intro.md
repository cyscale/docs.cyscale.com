# Overview

Welcome to the Cyscale documentation website. Here you can find out more about what the Cyscale Cloud Platform is, how it works, and when to use it.

## Cyscale Cloud Platform

Cyscale Cloud Platform (Cyscale for short) helps you build and run secure and compliant cloud environments.

If you ask Gartner, Cyscale is a CSPM (cloud security posture management) platform (for now). While these labels are useful for seasoned security engineers and for getting an idea of what the platform can do, most cloud engineers and architects aren’t necessarily accustomed to these terms, so here is what Cyscale can do today:

- **It acts as a central place to view all your cloud resources (i.e. asset inventory).**

  You connect your cloud accounts through provider-specific secure and simple mechanisms and Cyscale starts discovering your infrastructure through the providers' SDKs/APIs. It stores a snapshot of your cloud infrastructure in a unified data format thus being able to uncover more complex scenarios and assess various rules.

  Cyscale gives you an overview of your cloud infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, multiple accounts, and multiple regions.

- **It verifies your infrastructure against controls and best practices described in CIS benchmarks and Well-Architected Frameworks.**

  Once your cloud assets are discovered, Cyscale starts checking them against common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities helping you build more secure and robust systems. Cyscale runs these checks whenever your assets are synchronized and shows you the identified issues in the form of alerts.

- **Cyscale tracks your compliance with industry standards and policies alongside your internal policies**

  The previously mentioned controls are also mapped to standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, HIPAA. In general, these standards only tell you what to do, but not how. For example, most standards will tell you to use encryption and MFA, but each provider, platform, and even service offers specific ways to use these features. Using Cyscale’s powerful policy editor, you can specify precisely how each section or requirement of a standard or policy is covered within your organization.
