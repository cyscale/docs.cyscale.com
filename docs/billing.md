## Usage

The main usage metric in Cyscale is the asset. This represents a node in the [Security Knowledge Graph](./intro//overview.mdx#security-knowledge-graph). Examples of assets include EC2 instances, EBS volumes, VPCs, buckets, Azure AD users, Google Cloud service accounts, Okta applications, and so on.

Cyscale counts each unique resource seen at least once during the billing period as a separate asset.

You can always see how many assets Cyscale has read each month on the [usage page](https://app.cyscale.com/usage). The information could be delayed by a few minutes.

The billing period is monthly, starting on the first of each month.

:::tip Bonus
