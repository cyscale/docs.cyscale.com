## Usage

The main usage metric in Cyscale is the asset. This represents a node in the [Security Knowledge Graph](./intro//overview.mdx#security-knowledge-graph). Examples of assets include EC2 instances, EBS volumes, VPCs, buckets, Azure AD users, GCP service accounts, Okta applications, and so on.

Cyscale counts each unique resource seen at least once during the billing period as a separate asset.

The billing period is monthly, starting on the first of each month.

:::tip Bonus
Once we establish our agreement, you will be billed starting next month. Until then, it's on us.
